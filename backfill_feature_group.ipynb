Hence, early identification and classification of plant diseases are essential. This paper aims to classify mango plant leaves into healthy and diseased using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

These models are trained using the Mendeley dataset, validation accuracies are found and compared with and without the use of transfer learning models.

ResNet-50 (117 layers, 23 million parameters) and VGG-16 (16 layers, 138 million parameters) have given testing accuracies of 98.56\\% and 98.26\\% respectively.
